# 101days
A (not-so-subtle) continuation on Coells' 100 days (https://github.com/coells/100days)

Here are some of the algorithms I want to implement (categorized working list). Note that for different categories, I'll take different implementations for granted (i.e. in RANSAC, I'll assume we have a linear regression implementation). These are roughly listed in order of difficulty within a category:

## Basic Math
- RANSAC
- Conway's Game of Life
- FFT
- QR Algorithm
- GMM (EM)
- Chien search

## Basic CS
- Convex hull
- A*

## Foundational ML
- Logistic regression
- Decision tree
- Decision forest
- Spectral embedding
- PCA
- LDA
- Adaboost
- SVM

## Graphics
- Delaunay triangulation
- Voronoi diagram

## Computer Vision
- ORB
- Stereo depth estimation
